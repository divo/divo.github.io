## Overview
Unskippable app limits

{{< icon-image "/images/unplug-icon.png" >}}

## Problem
Like many people I don't always put my phone down at night when I should. Those carefully curated feeds of content are very enticing, and the native iOS screen time limits are far too easy to bypass.

There has been an explosion of Screen Time apps ever since Apple opened up the API but generally, they require a subscription or have limits that can still be easily ignored.

I wanted a limit I couldn't ignore, even if I wanted to. So I built Unplug.

## Solution
Unplug is a very simple app. Set a daily limit using the familiar activity picker and that's it. The screen time shield cannot be bypassed. You simply have to wait for the limit period to end.
