## Skills and Interests

I have a love for technology and enjoy tinkering with a wide range of things in my spare time. I am driven to become an expert in my field, but I also believe maintaining knowledge of a broad range of topics is beneficial. I enjoy learning new things when I have time. I am very diligent and regimented with an interest in time management. To me this is a skill that takes practice.
